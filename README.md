# ZipLite — File Compression Tool in C

📋 Overview

ZipLite is a full-stack file compression platform built using C, Python, and JavaScript. The project implements classic lossless compression algorithms such as Run-Length Encoding (RLE) and Huffman Coding while integrating a Python Flask backend and interactive frontend dashboard.

The system demonstrates systems programming, backend integration, API communication, and frontend visualization in a modular architecture.

# 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

## Run-Length Encoding (RLE)

A lossless compression algorithm that compresses repeated character sequences into compact count-value pairs.

### Complexity

```text
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
```

---

## Huffman Coding

A lossless compression technique using:
- Binary Trees
- Frequency Analysis
- Min Heaps
- Prefix Encoding

Frequently occurring characters receive shorter binary codes for optimized compression.

### Complexity

```text
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
```
